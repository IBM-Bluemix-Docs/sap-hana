# 4. Downloading and installing SAP software and applications
{: #install_sap}

Log in to SAP Support and download the appropriate hardware and installation instructions. After your hardware and operating system have been installed, you need to install SAP HANA. For installation instructions, see [*SAP HANA Installation Guides and Implementation Help*](https://www.sap.com/products/hana/implementation/resources.html).

Your SAP HANA software must be installed by a certified SAP HANA installer who has completed the SAP HANA installation certification course. For more information, see [Who Can Install SAP HANA?](http://www.saphanacentral.com/p/who-can-install-sap-hana.html).

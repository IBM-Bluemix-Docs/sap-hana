# Bring your own license

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} for SAP Applications offering is bring your own license (BYOL); you need to apply the corresponding license for your SAP products after installation. If you are new to SAP, start exploring under [SAP All Products](https://go.sap.com/solution.html){: new window}.

If you purchased your SAP and {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} Linux, Unix, and Windows (LUW) licenses as part of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM)/application specific licensing (ASL) agreement, you can download and apply license files from the [SAP Service Marketplace](https://websmp201.sap-ag.de/){: new window}. For more information, see [SAP Note 816773-DB6](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/816773): Installing an SAP OEM license. However, if you purchased {{site.data.keyword.Db2_on_Cloud_short}} LUW from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} or an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partner, you must use the license files that are provided by your vendor instead.

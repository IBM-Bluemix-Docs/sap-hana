# 3. Installing your guest OS on the ESX hypervisor (optional)
{: #install_guest_os}

If you decide to use the pre-installed ESX hypervisor, you are responsible for installing the Red Hat Enterprise Linux for SAP HANA 7.4 OS as the guest operating system on top of the hypervisor. You need to make sure that the SAP HANA Tailored Data Center Integration (TDI) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are met for every virtual machine on which SAP HANA is deployed.

## Ordering your server
{: #order-server}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console requires a unique log-in IDs, which is an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}id. Use the following steps to order your {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}}. Additional information can be found under [Building a custom bare metal server](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-ordering-baremetal-server#ordering-baremetal-server).

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com){: external} with your unique credentials.
2. Click **Create resource** > **Compute** > **Infrastructure** > **Bare Metal Server** > **Continue**.
3. Enter the number of servers you are ordering in the **Quantity** field.
4. Enter a **Hostname**, which is a permanent or temporary name for your servers. SAP Hostnames must consist of a maximum of 13 alpha-numeric characters. See [SAP Notes 611361](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/611361){: external} and [129997](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/129997){: external} for more SAP Hostname details. Click **Information** for formatting specifics.
6. Enter a **Domain**, which is the identification string that defines administrative control within the internet. Click **Information** for formatting specifics.
